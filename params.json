Catalog of all the Stores in a mall\r\n2. Details of type of products available in each store\r\n3. Take me there - Text-based Indoor mall navigation]\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Brandstore project was started as a Startup and was launched for testing in one of the largest Malls in India. The primary goal was for the user to be able to search for any product in the mall [Apparel, footwear, accessories and many more categories] in a detailed approach yet with a simple UI. The goal was to index the whole mall and make it searchable for the User. Following the lean approach, we took to testing within a few months with a working application. But after multiple rounds of testing and re-iteration, we realized that the product was not scalable enough to be a Successful startup. There simply wasn't a \"10X problem\" to target. However, our text-based \"Take me there\" functionality was highly in demand by multiple vendors. So, we are open sourcing the product as a whole for Other developers to contribute and use.\r\n\r\nThe UI Front end is an Android app, while the server was a Nodejs setup (using Sails) running on an EC2 instance. \r\n\r\nThis project is the source code for the Brandstore Android application. You can find the app on [Google Play] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brandstore1)\r\n\r\nThe Nodejs server code is also available [here] (https://github.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreServer)\r\n\r\n\r\n### üì± Mockups\r\n\r\n\r\nScreen name | Screen mockup\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nLogin Screen | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/login.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nHome Screen | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/home.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nSearch | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/search1.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nSearch - example | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/search2.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nBrands list | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/brandlist.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nBrands list | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/brandlist.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nBrands list (with filters) | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/brandlist%20filter.png\" width=\"300\">\r\nBrand details | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/branddetails.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n\r\n### Take me there screens\r\n\r\nFloating action button > Enter nearest store > Result of TMT > Change destination\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/takemethere1.png\" width=\"200\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/takemethere2.png\" width=\"200\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/takemethere3.png\" width=\"200\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/master/media/mockups/takemethere4.png\" width=\"200\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements\r\n\r\n* Requires to be downloaded and then imported as an Android project.\r\n* Not available on any Package Manager yet.\r\n\r\n### üîë License\r\nBrandstore is released and distributed under the terms and conditions of the [Apache License](https://github.com/srinathwarrier/BrandstoreApp/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\r\n\r\n### üë• Contributions\r\nIf you run into problems, please open up an issue.
